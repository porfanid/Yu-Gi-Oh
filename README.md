# Yu-Gi-Oh
This app is created so that it can be possible to simulate the Yu-Gi-Oh game in real life. This project will be devided into 2 apps. A server one and a client one. The server one willbe written in c# and will be run on windows computers, and the client one will be written in arduino. In  order to make it as cool as possible, I think that the arduino should have the shape of a Yu-Gi-Oh dueling deck and the cards will be recognised by using NFC tags, for instance. Right now, I have written some of the code for the server part to run, however, I still have some difficulties. Also, I need to create the software and hardware for the decks to, as well as for the dueling platform. How am I supposed to do all that? I created issues on github. So if anyone finds out a solution , he can promote it there.
